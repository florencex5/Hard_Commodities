        * Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)
        * Consumer Sentiment Index (Univerisity of Michigan)
    *Defined Timeframes*
        * Past Decade: November 2014 – November 2024
        * COVID-19 Period: March 2020 – May 2023
        * Post-COVID Period: June 2023 – November 2024
         

* **Analysis Methods**
   * Time Series Analysis
   * Hypothesis Testing: Correlation (Pearson & Spearman rank)
   * 
    
* **Limitation**
    * A key limitation arises from aligning monthly macroeconomic indicators with daily commodity trading prices. To ensure consistency and comparability, global copper and aluminum prices are used in place of daily futures trading prices for certain segments of the analysis.
    * small sample size (post Covid period)

## ANALYSIS
* **Historical Correlation Trends of Hard Commodities**
    1. *Copper & Aluminum*
         * Over a 30-year period from January 1990 to November 2024, copper and aluminum prices demonstrated a robust positive correlation, with a coefficient of 0.846.This indicates a traditional “complementary” relationship, where an increase in the price of one commodity typically aligns with a rise in the other.

* ** Market Relevant Indicators and Hard Commodity Interconnections**
    * **Factor 1: Headline CPI**
        * * **Introduction** * 
            * The relationship between hard commodities and consumer price indices (CPI) has significantly shifted in today’s climate-driven world, marked by the rapid growth of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs). These commodities, essential for green energy infrastructure and EV production, contribute to dynamic trends in the CPI while also being influenced by them.
            * Inflation, as reflected by the CPI, drives commodity prices in futures markets, influencing costs and market sentiment. In turn, the essential role of hard commodities in infrastructure and renewable technologies feeds back into consumer prices. Climate-related policies further complicate this dynamic, introducing additional factors—such as various market indicators—that influence the interconnectedness between hard commodities and economic conditions.
        * * **Variability in CPI and PCE** *
            * Over the past decade, headline CPI, core CPI, and PCE have exhibited similar trends, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they displayed a distinct “bump” pattern. However, Energy CPI stands out due to its significantly higher volatility, with a variance of 197.522 compared to headline CPI’s 5.231.
            * Within the Energy CPI category, Energy Commodities CPI—which includes gasoline (all types) and fuel oil—is the most volatile component, accounting for approximately 268.24% of the total Energy CPI variance. Notably, Energy CPI recorded a negative annual percentage change of -1.279% in February 2023, plunging further to -26.925% in June 2023. Although it rebounded slightly by November 2024 to -8.458%, energy commodities remained negative for more than a year, reflecting prolonged oversupply or weakened demand.
        * * **Headline CPI vs. Copper and Aluminum Prices** *
            * The comparison with headline CPI is initiated for two primary reasons. First, headline CPI captures a broad spectrum of price changes across the economy. Second, despite the increased fluctuation that comes from its inclusion of energy and food prices, the strong correlation between energy prices and hard commodity prices makes headline CPI an appropriate starting point for analyzing the broader economic implications.     
            * When headline CPI is integrated with copper and aluminum prices, strong positive correlations emerge: 0.735 for copper and 0.828 for aluminum. These values suggest that as commodity prices increase, headline CPI tends to rise correspondingly. However, this relationship presents contradictions. While rising CPI typically reduces purchasing power and curtails demand, simultaneous increases in commodity prices often signal heightened demand—implying the influence of additional factors.These inconsistencies underline the complexity of CPI and commodity price dynamics in a climate-driven world. Variables such as stock market performance, influenced by advancements like AI, may also play a critical role in shaping these interconnections.

    * **Type**
        * **Headline and Core CPI**
            * The correlation between headline CPI and hard commodity prices has shifted over time. In both the past decade and the COVID-19 period, positive correlations were observed. However, in the post-COVID period, the relationship reversed, with rising commodity prices coinciding with falling CPI. Due to the limited post-COVID sample size (fewer than 30 data points), statistical significance may be impacted. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis reveals the following:
                * **Copper**: Significant correlation only with core CPI (r = -0.709).
                * **Aluminum**: Significant correlations with both headline and core CPI, with the strongest correlation with core CPI (r = -0.7626).
            * During the past decade and the COVID-19 period, headline CPI demonstrated stronger correlations with commodity prices. However, in the post-COVID period, core CPI exhibited a stronger negative correlation:
                * **Copper**: headline CPI (r=-0.391) v.s. core CPI (r= -0.709)
                * **Aluminum**: headline CPI (r=-0.562) v.s. core CPI (r= -0.763)
            * These reversals underscore the increasing influence of factors beyond inflationary trends, indicating that additional variables now play a more significant role in shaping the relationship between CPI and commodity prices.
        * **Energy CPI and Its Components: Energy Commodities and Energy Services**
            * Energy-related CPI components consistently exhibit positive correlations with hard commodity prices across all analyzed periods: the past decade, the COVID-19 period, and the post-COVID period. Notably, during the post-COVID period, Energy Services CPI—encompassing utility services like piped gas and electricity—showed significant shifts:
                1. Increased Correlations (compared to the COVID-19 period):
                    * **Copper**: Correlation rose to 0.8824, a 64% increase.
                    * **Aluminum**: Correlation increased to 0.8019, an 18% rise.
                2. Sustained Significant Correlations:
                    * Unlike Energy Commodities CPI, which showed no significant correlation, Energy Services CPI maintained its strong linkage with both metals.
            * These shifts highlight copper’s pivotal role in electricity infrastructure, such as power grids essential for EV production. The post-COVID surge aligns with the global green energy transition, reinforced by COP28 and its emphasis on phasing out fossil fuels.
