# The Interconnectedness -- Analysis Report & Methodology

## THE PROBLEM
* What role does climate change play in reshaping the relationship between major hard commodities?


## METHODOLOGY
* **Data Selection**
    *Major commodities*
        * Pair 1: Copper Aluminum
        * Pair 2: 
    *Market Relevant Indicators*
        * Headline Consumer Price Index(CPI),Core CPI,Energy CPI,Energy Service CPI, Energy Commodities CPI,
        * Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)
        * Consumer Sentiment Index (Univerisity of Michigan)
        *
         
    

* **Analysis Methods**
   * Time Series Analysis
   * Hypothesis Testing: Correlation (Pearson & Spearman rank)
   * 
    
* **Limitation**
    * A key limitation arises from aligning monthly macroeconomic indicators with daily commodity trading prices. To ensure consistency and comparability, global copper and aluminum prices are used in place of daily futures trading prices for certain segments of the analysis.

## Analysis
* **Historical Correlation Trends of Hard Commodities**
    1. *Copper & Aluminum*
         * Over a 30-year period from January 1990 to November 2024, copper and aluminum prices demonstrated a robust positive correlation, with a coefficient of 0.846.This indicates a traditional “complementary” relationship, where an increase in the price of one commodity typically aligns with a rise in the other.

    * The comparison with headline CPI is initiated for two primary reasons. First, headline CPI captures a broad spectrum of price changes across the economy. Second, despite the increased fluctuation that comes from its inclusion of energy and food prices, the strong correlation between energy prices and hard commodity prices makes headline CPI an appropriate starting point for analyzing the broader economic implications.
    * The relationship between hard commodities and consumer price indices (CPI) has significantly shifted in today’s climate-driven world, marked by the rapid growth of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs). These commodities, essential for green energy infrastructure and EV production, contribute to dynamic trends in the CPI while also being influenced by them.
    * Inflation, as reflected by the CPI, drives commodity prices in futures markets, influencing costs and market sentiment. In turn, the essential role of hard commodities in infrastructure and renewable technologies feeds back into consumer prices. Climate-related policies further complicate this dynamic, introducing additional factors—such as various market indicators—that influence the interconnectedness between hard commodities and economic conditions.
