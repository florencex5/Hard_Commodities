# The Sustainable Growth Rate -- Analysis Report & Methodology


## METHODOLOGY
* **Data Selection**
    1. Country: Chile
        * Chile holds a leading position in global mining production, contributing approximately 23% of the world's copper (1st place) and 25% of its lithium (2nd place) as of 2023.
    2. Critical Minerals: Lithium & Copper
        * Chile, the world's top copper producer and home to the "lithium triangle," is prominent in both copper and lithium mining. This geographical concentration justifies focusing on these minerals. Analyzing lithium and copper in Chile, with an emphasis on sustainable growth rates, highlights the significance of various influencing factors.
    3. Demand v.s. The sustainable growth rate
        * The years 2030 and 2035 were selected to assess the impact of different starting years on sustainable growth rates, with the anticipation that future technological advancements will significantly influence demand.
* **Limitation**
    * The original IEA database provides predictions from 2030 to 2050, with an average interval of 5 years. The 7-year gap between the base year of 2023 and the first prediction year of 2030 may impact the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses of demand changes.




## KEY FINDINGS
* The pronounced demand surge, followed by a hard commodity cooldown during the climate transition, emphasizes the necessity of excluding such spikes in forecasting long-term growth rates, often influenced by infrequent factors like policy shifts. Accounting for potential future technological advancements is crucial when compounding growth rates from the subsequent period.

3. **Demand v.s. The Sustainable Growth Rate**
  * **COPPER**
    1. *Change in Total Demand (Per Each Period)*
         * Total demand for copper increases across all scenarios but at a decelerating rate over time.
           * For instance, in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), while there are fluctuations in the percentage change in demand, the overall trend shows a slower rate of increase. Compared to 2023, demand in 2030 increases by 19.17%. However, from 2045 to 2050, demand increases by only 4.19%, acknowledging the difference in time spans (7 years versus 5 years).
          * Cyclical Demand v.s. Defensive Demand
            * Understanding copper demand dynamics requires differentiating between cyclical and defensive demand. Cyclical demand, as seen in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.On the other hand, defensive demand stems from critical infrastructure and renewable energy ventures affected by climate policies. Although defensive demand may seem robust initially, it might encounter sluggish growth after project fulfillment. Recognizing these distinctions is pivotal when calculating long-term sustainble growth rates based on overall demand forecasts.
    2. *Different Beginning Year, Same Time Periods -- **Excel [1a) & 1b)]***
        * Over identical time periods, the long-term sustainable growth rate, calculated from different starting years, exhibits significant variance. These fluctuations generally correspond with changes in demand for each respective period, highlighting the sensitivity of growth projections to initial conditions and market dynamics at different points in time.
    3. *Different Time Frame, All else equal -- **Excel [(2)]***
        * The long-term sustainable growth rate decreases with increasing time periods, potentially exerting a negative impact on equity valuation. Comparing the growth rate changes between the shortest time period (7 years) and the longest time period (27 years) across all scenarios, the average percentage change of long-term sustainable growth rate reduces by approximately 48%. Under the Net Zero Emission 2050 scenario, the percentage growth rate reduction is the highest at 54.45%

  * **LITHIUM**
    1. *Change in Total Demand (Per Each Period)*
          * Total demand for lithium, like copper, increases across all scenarios but at a decelerating rate over time.
          * * According to the IEA 2024 Global Critical Minerals Report, compared to 2023, lithium demand in 2030 is projected to increase significantly: 185% under the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), 222% under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and 327% under the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). However, the increase in demand by 2035 cools down below 100% across all scenarios. This suggests that the substantial surge from 2023 to 2030 should be excluded when predicting long-term growth rates, if these increases are likely driven by infrequent factors such as strong policy changes (e.g., the US 2023 EV Mandate),etc. Additionally, when compounding the growth rate from 2030, it is essential to consider and appropriately adjust for potential future technological advancements to accurately reflect anticipated changes in demand and supply.(E.g.

    2. *Different Beginning Year, Same Time Periods -- **Excel [1a) & 1b)]***
          * When analyzing growth rates for lithium, starting from different years but over the same time periods, a clear decreasing trend emerges, aligning with the continuous reduction in total demand change for each period. Specifically, growth rates calculated from 2035 are lower than those from 2030, reflecting the ongoing decline in demand.
    3. *Different Time Frame, All else equal -- **Excel [(2)]***
          * Under the NZE scenario highlighted by the IEA, lithium demand is projected to increase tenfold by 2050 compared to 2023. While this prediction is plausible based on current technology, it remains vulnerable to substitution risks from future hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Diversifying investments into other renewable energy vehicle technologies is necessary for ensuring balanced preparation on both the supply and demand sides. Additionally, due to robust demand, the percentage change in growth rate from the longest (27 years) to the shortest (7 years) period is more evident for lithium than for copper, with the highest reduction reaching 60.57% for lithium and 54.45% for copper under the NZE scenario.
  * **QUICK RECAP**
    * Strong demand doesn't ensure sustainable growth rates, especially in climate-exposed industries like energy companies trading hard commodities. While demand trends offer insights, determining compounded growth rates requires careful consideration of the time frame, particularly amid climate change, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. Traditional metrics used to determine sustainable growth rates, such as return on capital and reinvestment rate, return on equity and earnings retention rate may not fully capture climate-related risks. They're limited by their reliance on specific fiscal years and lack forward-looking assessments.
    * The sustainable growth rate is a essential component of equity valuation. Using If only considered at the denominator level, changes in magnitude may appear small, but when combined with the numerator (e.g., FCFF, dividends), the impact on the valuation can be substantial.
    * The significant demand surge followed by a cooling trend in a hard commodity, particularly during the climate transition period, underscores the need to exclude such surges when predicting long-term growth rates, often influenced by infrequent factors like policy changes. Adjusting for potential future technological advancements remains essential when compounding growth rates from the subsequent period.
    * Distinguishing between cyclical and defensive demand in hard commdodity is essential for accurately assessing growth projections, with cyclical demand linked to economic cycles and defensive demand, driven by essential infrastructure and renewable energy, potentially facing slower growth post-project completion.
