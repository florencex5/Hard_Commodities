# The Sustainable Growth Rate -- Analysis Report & Methodology


## KEY FINDINGS
* The pronounced demand surge, followed by a hard commodity cooldown during the climate transition, emphasizes the necessity of excluding such spikes in forecasting long-term growth rates, often influenced by infrequent factors like policy shifts. Accounting for potential future technological advancements is crucial when compounding growth rates from the subsequent period.

    **COPPER**
    *1. Change in Total Demand (Per Each Period)*
      * Total demand for copper increases across all scenarios but at a decelerating rate over time.
            * For instance, in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), while there are fluctuations in the percentage change in demand, the overall trend shows a slower rate of increase. Compared to 2023, demand in 2030 increases by 19.17%. However, from 2045 to 2050, demand increases by only 4.19%, acknowledging the difference in time spans (7 years versus 5 years).
      * Cyclical Demand v.s. Defensive Demand
            * Understanding copper demand dynamics requires differentiating between cyclical and defensive demand. Cyclical demand, as seen in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.On the other hand, defensive demand stems from critical infrastructure and renewable energy ventures affected by climate policies. Although defensive demand may seem robust initially, it might encounter sluggish growth after project fulfillment. Recognizing these distinctions is pivotal when calculating long-term sustainble growth rates based on overall demand forecasts.
    *2. Different Beginning Year, Same Time Periods [1a) & 1b)]*
        * Over identical time periods, the long-term sustainable growth rate, calculated from different starting years, exhibits significant variance. These fluctuations generally correspond with changes in demand for each respective period, highlighting the sensitivity of growth projections to initial conditions and market dynamics at different points in time.
    *3. Different Time Frame, All else equal [(2)]*
        * All else being equal, the long-term sustainable growth rate decreases with increasing time periods, potentially exerting a negative impact on equity valuation. Comparing the growth rate changes between the shortest time period (7 years) and the longest time period (27 years) across all scenarios, the average percentage change of growth rate reduces by approximately 48%. Under the Net Zero Emission 2050 scenario, the percentage growth rate reduction is the highest at 54.45%

    **LITHIUM**
    *1. Change in Total Demand (Per Each Period)*
      * Total demand for lithium, like copper, increases across all scenarios but at a decelerating rate over time.
      * According to the IEA 2024 Global Critical Minerals Report, compared to 2023, lithium demand in 2030 is projected to increase significantly: 185% under the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), 222% under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and 327% under the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). However, the increase in demand by 2035 cools down below 100% across all scenarios. This suggests that the substantial surge from 2023 to 2030 should be excluded when predicting long-term growth rates, if these increases are likely driven by infrequent factors such as strong policy changes (e.g., the US 2023 EV Mandate),etc. Additionally, when compounding the growth rate from 2030, it is essential to consider and appropriately adjust for potential future technological advancements to accurately reflect anticipated changes in demand and supply.(E.g.

    *Quick Recap*
        * Strong demand does not necessarily equate to a sustainable growth rate. Different scenarios lead to varying levels of demand. When computing the growth rate, the time frame (e.g., compounding frequency) and the choice of the starting year are crucial in determining the growth rate, especially in the current context of climate change and regulatory shifts.
        * The sustainable growth rate is a essential component of equity valuation. Using If only considered at the denominator level, changes in magnitude may appear small, but when combined with the numerator (e.g., FCFF, dividends), the impact on the valuation can be substantial. 
        * The significant demand surge followed by a cooling trend in a hard commodity, particularly during the climate transition period, underscores the need to exclude such surges when predicting long-term growth rates, often influenced by infrequent factors like policy changes. Adjusting for potential future technological advancements remains essential when compounding growth rates from the subsequent period.
        * Distinguishing between cyclical and defensive demand in hard commdodity is essential for accurately assessing growth projections, with cyclical demand linked to economic cycles and defensive demand, driven by essential infrastructure and renewable energy, potentially facing slower growth post-project completion.
