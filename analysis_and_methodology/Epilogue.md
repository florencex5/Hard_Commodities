# Epilogue

## About Cost & Profit
* The 19th-century Industrial Revolution was fueled by coal, driving economic progress for decades—just as China heavily relies on coal to support EV production today. History has shown the cost of prolonged fossil fuel dependence, and repeating the same mistakes is not an option. Profit enables action, but sustainability should guide it.The goal should be achieving profitability within a framework that balances cost and environmental impact.

## About Auto
* Cost-cutting, as seen with Tesla, or strategic partnerships like Volkswagen-Rivian and Hyundai-GM, reflect the industry’s push to stay competitive. But demand hasn’t shifted, and trimming costs alone isn’t a lasting solution. True progress comes from collaboration that drives innovation, not just efficiency.
* Regardless of politics, Tesla has been crucial in advancing the energy transition. More than just a car maker, it brought EVs into the mainstream. Tesla wasn’t the first, but it was the one to truly integrate electric mobility into daily life, giving us confidence in the future of EVs.
* And as BMW’s CEO Oliver Zipse noted: “Hydrogen is the missing piece of the puzzle for emission-free mobility, because a single technology will not be enough to enable climate-neutral mobility worldwide.”

## About President Biden
* The EV mandate, rolled out through executive action, lacked the infrastructure needed, causing stalled EV adoption and slowed production. With demand and supply misaligned, the transition has struggled.
* Like the auto industry, policies are cyclical—they’re easy to announce but tough to reverse. EIA data shows that from December 2023 to November 2024, electricity sales to transportation remained flat, with oil still dominant. Energy transition requires proactive leadership and a coordinated, industry-wide effort—climate change isn’t a solo act.


## About President Trump
* A presidential term lasts four years, and while a so-called “golden age of the U.S.” may begin on January 20, 2025, it will not include a commitment to the Paris Agreement. The estimated $1 trillion in cost savings from withdrawal will not halt rising global temperatures or mitigate worsening climate conditions.
* What kind of future does the president want to leave for your grandchildren?
* The orange skies over New York in the summer of 2023 and California’s recurring wildfires aren’t anomalies—they’re warnings. Climate change does not pause for political cycles, and ignoring it today only exacerbates the challenges of tomorrow.
