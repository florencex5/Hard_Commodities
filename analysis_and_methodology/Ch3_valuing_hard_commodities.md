* **Part 2: Reviewing Forecasting Approaches**
    * **Introduction**
        * In the [*previous analysis*](https://github.com/florencex5/Crude_Oil_Finance_Project), XGBoost was utilized for crude oil forecasting, but it lacked detailed statistical analysis. To address this, a multiple linear regression model will be applied to better understand the relationships between key factors and their coefficients. While crude oil prices may not exhibit a strictly linear relationship with these factors, this approach will provide a foundational understanding before advancing to more complex models like XGBoost.
