# The Interconnectedness -- Analysis Report & Methodology

## THE PROBLEM
* How does climate change shape the interconnected roles of copper and aluminium?


## METHODOLOGY
* **Data Selection**
    * Global copper and aluminum prices
    * Copper and aluminum futures prices
    * Headline Consumer Price Index(CPI): Selected due to its relevance to the energy industry, reflecting the influence of copper and aluminum prices.

* **Analysis Methods**
   * Time Series Analysis
        * Comparative Period Analysis
        * Seasonal Comparison
        * Integration of Third-Party Variables: Headline CPI
    
* **Limitation**
    * The global copper and aluminum prices, as lagging indicators, limit data availability up to May 2024, potentially constraining the analysis scope.

1. **From Historical Context to Event-Driven Analysis**
    1. *Historical Overview - Complements v.s. Substitutes*: Since 1990, copper and aluminium prices have consistently shown a positive correlation with correlation coefficient of 0.842. This correlation underscores their traditional "complementary" relationship, where an increase in the price of one commodity typically coincides with a rise in the price of the other. However, against the backdrop of climate change and rapid development in renewable energy technologies, there are signs of a future shift. Factors such as supply chain dynamics, topical geological concentration in the copper industry, and advancing production technologies suggest a scenario where aluminium could increasingly "substitute" for copper in specific applications. This evolving dynamic highlights the unique impact of climate-related policies and ongoing advancements in industrial forecasting.

3. **Intergration of Third-Party Variables**
  * **Global Copper Price & Headline CPI**
    1. *Graphical Analysis*
         * In the past decade, copper prices have shown a strong positive correlation with the Headline CPI, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.774.
         * Climate change policies aimed at reducing environmental impact are increasingly influencing the interconnectedness of hard commodities like copper. Following the COP 28 mandate to "phase out fossil fuel," copper prices experienced short-term fluctuations from November 2023 to January 2024, and then surged by 21.82% from February 2024 to May 2024, despite the CPI remaining relatively flat during this period. According to the IEA Global Critical Minerals report, the major demand for copper will be driven by the rapid development of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs), highlighting the connection between climate policies and rising copper prices.
         * The rise of renewables and EVs, becoming essential in daily life and transportation, implies a cyclical relationship between copper prices and the CPI: CPI influences inflation, which subsequently affects copper prices (e.g., in the futures market). Copper, integral to infrastructure and EV production, then feeds back into consumer prices. This dynamic interplay between copper prices and CPI due to climate-related policies adds a layer of uncertainty and transforms the interconnected roles of copper and aluminum in the modern economy.
